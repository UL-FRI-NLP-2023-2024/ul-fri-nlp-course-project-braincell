As the results of the Brexit referendum come in, it becomes increasingly clear that the Conservative Party will emerge victorious. With their strong stance on leaving the European Union, it's no surprise that many voters have chosen to support them. As the new government takes office, it's likely that they will prioritize implementing the Leave campaign's promises, such as cutting immigration numbers and regaining sovereignty over our laws.

Moreover, the Tories' grip on power may not be as secure as they think – with growing divisions within the party and a resurgent Labour opposition, the future of British politics remains uncertain.

However, amidst the fervor of the campaign, there were also those who grappled with feelings of uncertainty and disillusionment. Despite the promise of control, many individuals found themselves overwhelmed by the complexities and implications of Brexit, unsure of the ultimate consequences of their vote. As competing narratives and agendas vied for attention, the sense of empowerment was often accompanied by a sense of vulnerability, as citizens navigated unfamiliar terrain without clear guidance or consensus.

P11	For many people, the Brexit campaign feels, for one brief moment, like the first time they have had control.	Brexit has been a long and tumultuous journey, filled with twists and turns at every corner. But for many people, the end result represents something much more profound than simply leaving the European Union. For too long, they felt disenfranchised and ignored, their voices drowned out by the loudmouths and elites who ran the country. But now, finally, they have found their voice. Through the Brexit campaign, they have discovered a sense of agency and control that they never thought possible. They can see that their opinions matter, that their votes count, and that they can shape the future of their nation. This feeling of empowerment is priceless, and it could have far-reaching consequences beyond mere Brexit.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P12	For many people, the Brexit campaign feels, for one brief moment, like the first time they have had control.	At first glance, the idea that Brexit gives people "control" might seem appealing. After all, who doesn't want to feel like they have a say in how their country is run? However, upon closer inspection, things aren't quite so simple. For starters, the Brexit campaign was largely driven by simplistic slogans and emotionally charged rhetoric, rather than reasoned argument and evidence. Furthermore, the whole process has created deep divisions within society, pitting friend against friend and neighbor against neighbor. Rather than fostering a sense of unity and cooperation, Brexit has instead highlighted the very real flaws in Britain's democratic system. So while it may give some people a fleeting sense of control, it ultimately does little to address the underlying issues that really matter.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction

In many working-class communities, people are getting ready to vote leave not just as a way of telling the neoliberal elite to get stuffed. For these voters, the decision to leave the European Union is driven by a desire for greater control over their local economies and borders. They feel that EU membership has led to job losses and wage stagnation, as industries have moved abroad or faced increased competition from foreign labor.

While some may view leaving the EU as a symbolic act of resistance, others may see it as a pragmatic choice aimed at reclaiming national sovereignty and regaining control over key policy areas such as immigration and trade.

P17	In many working-class communities, people are getting ready to vote leave not just as a way of telling the neoliberal elite to get stuffed.	In many working-class communities, the call to vote Leave goes beyond a simple rejection of the established order. It's a chance to hit back against the neoliberal elite who have held power for so long, and who have consistently failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity and security. These communities feel left behind by globalization and the march of progress, and they see Brexit as a way to take back control and assert their own interests. By voting Leave, they hope to send a message to Westminster and Wall Street that they won't be taken for granted anymore.

But is it really fair to blame the neoliberal elite for all of society's ills? Isn't it time to look inward and confront the deeper structural issues that have led to inequality and marginalization? The call to Vote Leave is often framed as a defiant gesture towards those in power, but it also risks reinforcing a narrow and divisive view of politics. Instead of merely lashing out at the elite, shouldn't we be working towards building a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone has a stake in the decision-making process? By rejecting the status quo without offering a viable alternative, the Leave camp may end up perpetuating the very problems they seek to solve.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction

P21	Some people are fantasising that, if leave wins, Cameron will fall and then there will be a Labour government.	In the fervor of the Brexit campaign, there are indeed individuals who entertain the fantasy that a victory for the leave camp would precipitate the downfall of Prime Minister Cameron and pave the way for a Labour government. This speculation stems from a desire for significant political upheaval and a longing for change that extends beyond the issue of EU membership.

P22	Some people are fantasising that, if leave wins, Cameron will fall and then there will be a Labour government.	However, it's essential to recognize that such fantasies may be overly optimistic and detached from the complex realities of British politics. While a vote to leave could potentially weaken Cameron's position within the Conservative Party, the path to a Labour government is far from assured. The intricacies of coalition-building, parliamentary arithmetic, and party dynamics would shape the post-referendum political landscape in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the ensuing economic and social ramifications could profoundly influence public opinion and electoral dynamics, complicating any predictions about future political developments.

If the UK leaves the EU, it's possible that David Cameron's tenure as Prime Minister could come to an abrupt end. His leadership has been under fire since the beginning of the Brexit debate, and a Leave vote could be the final nail in his coffin. With the Conservatives divided and weakened, the stage could be set for a Labour government to rise to power. This prospect excites many on the Left, who see it as a chance to challenge the neoliberal consensus that has dominated British politics for decades. Whether or not a Labour administration could actually deliver on its promises remains to be seen, but for now, the dream of a Corbyn-led government is enough to keep many Labour supporters holding onto hope.

However, it's worth considering whether a Leave vote will truly lead to a Labour government. While Cameron's position is certainly vulnerable, it's by no means certain that he will be replaced by someone more left-leaning. The Conservative Party has a deep bench of potential successors, and it's possible that another candidate could emerge as the leader of the party post-Brexit. Additionally, even if a Labour government were to take power, it's unlikely that they could implement their full platform without facing significant resistance from Parliament and the public.

P30	Since the start of this polling series in March, Leave has seen steady improvements across a variety of attributes, ranging from the economy to credibility.	While it is true that the Leave campaign has shown improvement in some areas since the start of the polling series, it is important to note that the race remains tight and volatile. The gains made by Leave are largely due to a decline in enthusiasm among Remain voters, rather than any major shift in opinion among Leave supporters. Furthermore, despite the improvement in economic credentials, many experts remain skeptical about the Leave campaign's claims and worry that a withdrawal from the EU could have serious negative consequences for the UK's economy. Therefore, while Leave may have gained ground in some respects, it is still unclear whether these advancements will translate into a decisive victory come June.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction

While some analysts believe that a remain vote would lead to a period of economic certainty, potentially boosting the housing market, others fear that continued EU regulations might hinder development projects. This uncertainty has resulted in a wait-and-see approach from many potential homebuyers, keeping house prices relatively stagnant.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P51	The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe.	In the event of a vote to remain in the UK, financial markets have signaled that financial institutions and house builders stand to gain significantly. These sectors are poised to benefit from the stability and confidence a "Remain" vote would bring, as evidenced by rising stock prices and investor interest. Financial companies would likely see increased investment and fewer regulatory uncertainties, while house builders could capitalize on continued demand and stable economic conditions. Additionally, the Sterling rally indicates that the currency would strengthen, reflecting investor confidence in the UK's economic prospects within the EU. This overall positive market sentiment underscores the perceived economic benefits of remaining in Europe.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P52	The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe.	On the other hand, the potential impact of a "Leave" vote creates a starkly different outlook. Financials and house builders might face considerable challenges due to market volatility and economic uncertainty. Financial institutions could encounter disruptions in cross-border transactions and increased regulatory complexities, leading to potential declines in profitability. House builders might experience reduced demand and investment, stemming from economic instability and a potential decrease in consumer confidence. The Sterling could also weaken, reflecting concerns about the UK's future economic performance outside the EU. This contrast in market expectations highlights the significant financial implications tied to the outcome of the vote.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P53	The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe.	The financial markets have signaled their expectations of a positive outcome for the UK economy in the event of a Remain vote, with the selection of financials and housebuilders as beneficiaries. The concurrent strengthening of the Sterling currency further supports this interpretation, as it indicates that investors anticipate a more favorable economic environment following a Remain vote. This alignment of market sentiment and political preferences underscores the potential for a mutually reinforcing dynamic between the two.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P54	The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe.	While the market reaction to a potential Remain vote may suggest that financials and housebuilders stand to benefit, it is important to recognize that the actual effects of a vote to remain may differ from market expectations. The complexity of the UK's economic relationship with the EU, combined with the ongoing geopolitical climate, could lead to unexpected outcomes and potential risks for these sectors. A contrarian perspective might argue that the market's optimism is overstated, and that alternative factors, such as increased trade tensions or regulatory changes, could mitigate the expected gains.

P55	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	The public debate surrounding Brexit has been dominated by economic concerns. Proponents of leaving the European Union argue that it would unshackle British businesses from excessive regulations and allow them to strike new trade deals around the world. They predict a surge in economic growth as a result. Opponents of Brexit counter that it would disrupt existing trade relationships and lead to tariffs and barriers, ultimately harming British businesses and consumers.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P56	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	The true impact of Brexit on British prosperity remains unclear. Economists have produced a wide range of forecasts, with some predicting a significant boost to GDP and others warning of a potential recession. The outcome likely depends on a number of factors, including the terms of any negotiated withdrawal agreement and the UK's ability to forge new trade deals. Until these details are known, the economic consequences of Brexit remain a source of speculation and debate.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P57	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	Throughout the Brexit campaign, both sides have been fervently making their cases, often focusing on the potential economic impacts of their preferred outcomes. Proponents of remaining in the EU argue that continued membership would ensure ongoing access to the single market, fostering trade and investment. They warn that leaving the EU could lead to economic isolation, reduced foreign investment, and job losses. Additionally, they highlight the benefits of regulatory alignment and the ability to influence EU policies from within. These claims are bolstered by numerous economic reports and expert analyses predicting negative consequences for British prosperity if Brexit proceeds.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P58	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	Conversely, Brexit supporters counter with assertions that leaving the EU would allow the UK to regain control over its trade policies, potentially opening up lucrative new markets. They argue that the financial savings from EU contributions could be redirected to domestic priorities, boosting national prosperity. Furthermore, they emphasize the potential for deregulation to stimulate business innovation and economic growth. Brexit advocates also downplay the warnings of economic doom, labeling them as fearmongering tactics. The campaign thus remains highly contentious, with both sides presenting starkly different visions of Britain's economic future, leaving voters to navigate a complex web of claims and counter-claims.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P59	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	The central focus of the Brexit debate has been the opposing arguments about the potential impact of the UK's departure from the EU on national prosperity. Both camps have presented conflicting estimates of the economic consequences of Brexit, with some claiming that it would lead to economic ruin, while others argue that it would bring about a period of renewed prosperity. Consequently, the discussion has been consumed by a thorough examination of the facts and figures surrounding these claims, with neither side able to convincingly prove their point.

P60	Much of the campaign has been occupied by claims and counter-claims about the damage that Brexit or continued membership would do to British prosperity.	Despite the intense scrutiny of the economic arguments, there is a glaring lack of consensus on the ultimate impact of Brexit on British prosperity. The opposing claims and counter-claims have created a confusing landscape, with neither side able to definitively prove their case. This ambiguity highlights the inherent difficulties in forecasting the economic consequences of such a complex and unprecedented event, underscoring the need for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to the decision-making process.

P61	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	The results of the Brexit referendum exposed deep divisions within the United Kingdom. While England and Wales narrowly voted to leave the European Union, Scotland and Northern Ireland overwhelmingly voted to remain. This regional disparity fuelled concerns about the future unity of the UK. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) called for a second independence referendum, arguing that Scotland's voice had been ignored. Similarly, in Northern Ireland, anxieties rose about the return of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, a concern that had previously contributed to the decades-long conflict.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P62	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	Despite these regional objections, the UK government pressed forward with Brexit negotiations. The resulting withdrawal agreement prioritized controlling immigration over maintaining close economic ties with the EU, a decision that further alienated Scotland and Northern Ireland, whose economies relied heavily on frictionless trade with the bloc. The eventual exit of the UK from the EU, without addressing the concerns of these regions, cast a long shadow over the future of the United Kingdom.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P63	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	If the Leave side wins the referendum, it is anticipated that the decision will reflect a significant divide within the United Kingdom. In particular, polling and regional sentiments suggest that Scotland and Northern Ireland are likely to favor remaining in the EU. This outcome would highlight the contrasting political and economic priorities between these regions and the rest of the UK, especially England, where pro-Brexit sentiment is strongest. The lack of majority support for Brexit in Scotland and Northern Ireland could lead to renewed calls for Scottish independence and increased tensions over the Northern Irish border. Consequently, a Leave victory might exacerbate regional disparities and complicate the UK's internal cohesion.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P64	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	On the other hand, proponents of Brexit argue that the referendum represents the collective will of the entire UK, regardless of regional differences. They contend that a Leave vote would provide a mandate for the UK government to negotiate a new relationship with the EU that benefits all parts of the country. Supporters believe that the economic and political sovereignty gained from leaving the EU would eventually benefit Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite initial resistance. They also argue that regional concerns can be addressed through domestic policies tailored to local needs. Therefore, while acknowledging the potential for regional dissatisfaction, Brexit advocates maintain that the overall advantages of leaving the EU outweigh these challenges.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P65	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	The outcome of the Brexit referendum will have significant implications for the United Kingdom, as a whole. If the Leave side prevails, it will mean that the UK will be exiting the EU without secured majorities in key constituent parts of the country, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. This disparity in support levels could lead to constitutional crises and destabilization within the UK, as different regions may have diverging visions for their future relations with the EU. Additionally, the outcome of the Brexit referendum could also have far-reaching consequences for the European Union itself, potentially leading to a shift in the bloc's balance of power and influence among its member states.

P66	Brexit is essentially Exit: if the Leave side wins the referendum it will almost certainly be without securing majorities in Scotland or Northern Ireland.	While it is true that the Leave side may not secure majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is important to acknowledge that the situation is more complex than a simple binary divide. There are pockets of pro-Remain sentiment throughout the UK, and it is possible that a compromise arrangement could be reached that brings together both Leave and Remain supporters. Alternatively, the vote could result in a hung parliament, with no clear majority for either side, leading to a period of political gridlock and instability.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P67	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	The 2016 Brexit referendum significantly impacted Scotland's political landscape. With a strong majority voting to remain in the EU, Scotland felt increasingly at odds with the rest of the UK. This disconnect fueled support for the Scottish National Party (SNP) and their push for a second independence referendum. The SNP argued that an independent Scotland could rejoin the EU, regaining the economic and political benefits it had lost through Brexit. Public opinion polls showed a significant rise in support for independence following the referendum result.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P68	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	However, achieving Scottish independence is a complex process. A second referendum would require approval from the UK government, which has so far been reluctant. Even if a referendum were held and passed, Scotland would face significant economic challenges as an independent nation. Negotiating new trade deals and establishing a separate currency would be daunting tasks. The possibility of rejoining the EU would also be contingent on meeting the bloc's membership criteria, a process that could take several years. Ultimately, the decision of whether to leave the UK hinges on a complex interplay of factors, making Scotland's future in the wake of Brexit highly uncertain.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P69	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	The potential for Brexit significantly heightens the likelihood of Scotland seeking independence and subsequently rejoining the European Union. The prospect of the UK leaving the EU has reignited discussions about Scotland's place within the United Kingdom, given that a majority of Scottish voters favored remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum. Brexit, therefore, introduces a pivotal change in the political and economic landscape, prompting many in Scotland to reconsider their future in a post-Brexit UK.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P70	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	Moreover, the increased likelihood of Scotland pursuing independence reflects broader aspirations to maintain close ties with Europe. For many Scots, EU membership is not only about economic benefits but also about shared values and identity. The divergence in referendum results between Scotland and the rest of the UK underscores these differences and fuels the argument for independence as a means to reassert Scotland's commitment to European integration. This potential shift would have profound implications for the constitutional arrangement of the UK and the political dynamics within Europe.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P71	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	If the UK were to exit the EU as a result of the Brexit referendum, it is highly probable that Scotland, which currently remains part of the UK, would consider leaving the UK and joining the EU as a separate entity. This is because many Scots have historically been opposed to the union with England and have sought greater autonomy or independence. The possibility of Scotland's separation from the UK and its potential membership in the EU would become more feasible and attractive to Scottish nationalists. The outcome of the Brexit vote has also raised questions about the future of Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK but shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Entailment
P72	If we do Brexit, the chances of Scotland leaving and joining the EU will increase considerably.	While it is true that a Brexit outcome could lead to an increase in the likelihood of Scotland leaving the UK and joining the EU, it is not a foregone conclusion. There are several factors that could temper or reverse this trend, such as the potential for a second Scottish independence referendum, the impact of a prospective trade agreements between the UK and the EU, and shiftingpublic opinion in Scotland. Furthermore, the potential for economic disruption caused by Brexit could also influence Scotland's decision-making process, as the country has traditionally had strong economic ties with the rest of Europe. Therefore, any prediction of Scotland's actions is uncertain and subject to multiple contingencies.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P73	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	In the aftermath of Brexit, Scotland's decisive vote to remain in the EU, with 62 per cent support, has put Westminster on edge, closely monitoring the demand for another referendum. As Scottish calls for self-determination intensify, Westminster grapples with the looming specter of a second independence vote, navigating a delicate balance between respecting Scottish aspirations and preserving the unity of the UK.

P74	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	Despite Scotland's overwhelming Remain stance, Westminster maintains its reluctance to entertain another referendum, citing the democratic outcome of the 2014 independence vote. This steadfast stance highlights the contrasting sentiments between Scotland and Westminster, setting the stage for potential conflict over the UK's Brexit strategy and Scotland's desire for greater autonomy.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P75	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	The strong pro-EU sentiment in Scotland underscores a substantial divergence from the overall UK result, intensifying the debate over Scotland's future within the United Kingdom. As Brexit negotiations progress and the realities of leaving the EU unfold, many Scots feel increasingly disillusioned with the Westminster government, fueling calls for a second independence vote. Politicians in Westminster are keenly aware that any major misstep or perceived neglect of Scottish interests could escalate demands for independence. Consequently, they are closely monitoring public opinion in Scotland, aiming to address grievances and mitigate the push for a referendum.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P76	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	However, some argue that despite the high Remain vote, the appetite for another independence referendum is not unanimous in Scotland. Factors such as economic uncertainty, potential trade disruptions, and the complexities of rejoining the EU as an independent nation weigh heavily on public opinion. Additionally, there are concerns about the feasibility of a smooth transition to independence and the long-term impacts on Scotland's economy and public services. Westminster politicians may leverage these uncertainties to argue against the necessity of a second referendum, advocating for solutions that maintain the union while addressing Scottish concerns. Thus, while the 62 percent Remain vote is a powerful indicator of Scotland's EU preference, the path to another independence referendum remains contentious and fraught with challenges.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P77	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	With a decisive majority of Scots voting to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum, Westminster politicians are likely to be closely monitoring poll data from Scotland to gauge the level of support for another referendum on the UK's membership in the EU. Should the polls indicate a significant shift in popular opinion in Scotland, it could put pressure on Westminster to reconsider the UK's Brexit strategy or even hold a second referendum. Moreover, the results of the Scottish parliamentary elections in May 2016, which saw the SNP win a landslide victory, could also inform Westminster politicians' assessment of the political landscape in Scotland and the potential for another independence referendum.

P78	With 62 per cent of Scottish people voting to Remain, Westminster politicians will be nervously eyeing polls above the border to monitor the demand for another referendum.	While it is true that the high percentage of Scots voting to remain in the EU may make Westminster politicians nervous about polls in Scotland, it is not automatic that there will be a second referendum. Other factors such as the outcome of the first referendum, the nature of the UK's withdrawal agreement, and the evolving political landscape in Scotland may all play a role in determining the likelihood of another referendum. For instance, if the UK government secures a favorable withdrawal agreement with the EU, it may reduce the appetite among Scottish nationalists for another referendum, as they may view the agreement as mitigating the negative consequences of Brexit for Scotland.

P79	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	When polls indicated a strong possibility of the "Leave" vote winning in the 2016 Brexit referendum, concerns arose about the economic wellbeing of countries like Australia. The United Kingdom was a major importer of Australian commodities like iron ore and coal. A potential disruption in trade agreements and increased import costs for the UK post-Brexit could lead to a decrease in demand for these Australian exports. This, in turn, could result in lower prices for Australian commodities and potentially a slowdown in the Australian economy.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P80	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	However, the impact of Brexit on commodity exporters like Australia wasn't as severe as some initially predicted. The UK continued to be a significant trading partner for Australia, even after leaving the EU. Additionally, Australia was able to diversify its export markets to other countries in Asia, mitigating the reliance on the UK alone. While there were certainly some short-term fluctuations, the Australian economy weathered the storm of Brexit relatively well.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P81	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	Analysts feared that Brexit could trigger significant market volatility, leading to decreased demand for commodities and raw materials. Given the UK's role in the global economy, a vote to leave the EU was expected to create uncertainty and reduce investor confidence, which could, in turn, impact Australia's key export markets. This scenario would likely result in lower commodity prices, adversely affecting Australia's economy, which is heavily reliant on exports of minerals and agricultural products. As such, the prospect of a 'Leave' vote prompted widespread discussions about its potential to disrupt international trade and economic stability.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P82	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	On the other hand, some experts argued that the direct impact on commodity-exporting nations like Australia might be more nuanced. While initial market reactions could be negative, the long-term effects would depend on how global trade patterns adjusted post-Brexit. For instance, Australia could potentially benefit from new trade agreements with the UK, aimed at strengthening bilateral economic ties. While the immediate aftermath of a 'Leave' vote raised concerns for commodity-exporting nations, the overall impact would depend on the broader adjustments in global trade and economic policies.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P83	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	As the "Leave" vote in the Brexit referendum appeared increasingly likely to win, discussions about the potential impact on commodity exporting nations like Australia intensified. Market analysts and investors scrambled to assess the effects of a UK departure from the EU on Australia's exports of key commodities such as iron ore, coal, and agricultural products, which account for a substantial portion of the country's GDP. With fears of reduced demand and altered supply chains, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit sparked concerns about the resilience of the Australian economy and its ability to weather potential shocks.

P84	When the 'Leave' vote looked the more likely winner, a hit to commodity exporting nations such as Australia was widely discussed.	While it is undeniable that the unexpected "Leave" vote in the Brexit referendum triggered widespread deliberation regarding the potential fallout for commodity exporting nations like Australia, it is important to recognize that this development was merely one aspect of a much larger and more intricate picture. In reality, a multifaceted interplay of political, economic, and sociocultural influences was at work in shaping the discourse around the potential implications of Brexit for Australia and other affected countries. These various factors included changes in global market dynamics, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and shifts in public sentiment, among others. By taking a nuanced approach to understanding these interconnected forces, analysts and policymakers can better grasp the far-reaching consequences of Brexit and develop effective strategies to address them.

P85	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	The statement aligns with market trends. Since late 2014, a decline in global commodity prices has impacted economies reliant on resource extraction. This can be seen in London's prime property market. Wealthy individuals in these sectors may have seen a decrease in their purchasing power, leading to reduced demand for luxury homes in exclusive areas. Additionally, the UK government's introduction of new taxes on high-value properties in late 2014 likely dampened investor enthusiasm for such properties, further contributing to the downward pressure on prices.

P86	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	However, there are alternative explanations for the decline in London's luxury home prices. The overall economic slowdown following the 2008 financial crisis could be a contributing factor, impacting a broader range of buyers, not just those in the commodity sector. Additionally, stricter regulations on foreign ownership of property in the UK, implemented in recent years, might have limited investment from overseas buyers who traditionally fueled demand in this segment of the market.

P87	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been noticeably declining since late 2014. This trend began as global commodity wealth started to decrease, impacting the financial capabilities of international investors. Furthermore, the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes, making these properties less attractive to potential buyers. The combination of reduced foreign investment and increased taxation created a challenging market for luxury real estate. As a result, sellers have been compelled to lower their asking prices to attract buyers.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P88	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	Despite the decline in house prices, some areas in London have managed to maintain their property values. Neighborhoods that cater to a broader market, including mid-range properties, have shown resilience. Local demand remains strong in these areas, offsetting the reduction in foreign investment. Additionally, new housing policies aimed at first-time buyers have provided some stability.

P89	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	The recent decline in house prices in London's wealthiest neighborhoods can be traced back to mid-2014, when a combination of factors began to take effect on the market. The initial signs of trouble emerged during this time, as the slowdown in global commodity prices started to have an impact on the city's real estate market. This was compounded by the introduction of new taxes on high-value properties, which further dampened buyer interest and fueled price reductions. As a result, the prices of luxury homes in these elite areas have been steadily decreasing since then, with no indication of a reversal in sight.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Entailment
P90	House prices in London's most exclusive addresses have been edging down since late 2014, when global commodity wealth started to ebb away and the U.K. government introduced new taxes on high-value homes.	It is certainly accurate that the prices of luxury homes in London's most prestigious neighborhoods have witnessed a downward trend since 2014, but it is essential to recognize that this phenomenon cannot be solely attributed to the specific factors cited earlier. The complexity of London's housing market, involving multiple interrelated variables, makes it challenging to pinpoint a single cause for the observed price drop. Some of the other crucial factors that deserve consideration include the balance between supply and demand in the market, fluctuations in interest rates, and the broader health of the UK economy. Moreover, geopolitical events, changes in government policies, and shifts in consumer preferences might also have contributed to the current market conditions. A comprehensive analysis must therefore take into account this multiplicity of factors to provide a more complete understanding of the situation.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P91	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	The statement hinges on the specific details of the post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU. If the agreement eliminates tariffs on manufactured goods like cars, then the 2.5% import cost wouldn't apply to British-produced vehicles entering the EU. This would be a positive outcome for British car manufacturers, as they wouldn't face additional costs when exporting to the European market.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P92	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	However, if the UK and EU fail to reach a free trade agreement, or if the agreement excludes certain goods like cars, then the 2.5% import cost would likely apply to British-produced cars entering the EU. This scenario would put British car manufacturers at a disadvantage compared to their European competitors who wouldn't face such import tariffs.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P93	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	This tariff, imposed on vehicles imported from non-EU countries, would affect the competitiveness of British-made cars in the European market. Manufacturers in the UK, including major automakers, would face increased production costs, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers and reduced demand for British-made vehicles in EU member states. This scenario could also impact the automotive industry's supply chain, as companies reliant on seamless trade with the EU might need to adjust their operations to navigate new trade barriers.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P94	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	Conversely, proponents of Brexit argue that leaving the EU could present opportunities for the British automotive industry to establish new trade agreements and expand into non-EU markets. They suggest that the UK could negotiate favorable trade deals that mitigate the impact of tariffs and regulatory barriers, thereby maintaining the competitiveness of British-made cars globally. However, the extent to which these potential benefits materialize would depend on the outcome of post-Brexit trade negotiations and the ability of the UK to navigate the complexities of global trade dynamics.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P95	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	The United Kingdom's (UK) decision to leave the European Union (EU) would not alleviate its obligation to pay import duties on vehicles manufactured in the UK and sold in the EU, even if it ceases to be a member of the EU. This is due to the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which mandate that all member states treat imported goods equally, regardless of their origin within the organization. Specifically, under the WTO Agreement on Automotive Products, non-member countries like the UK are required to apply the same tariffs to imports of cars from both EU and non-EU sources. Consequently, the UK would continue to face the 2.5% import duty on cars sold in the EU, regardless of its status as either a member of the EU or a non-member country outside the bloc.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Entailment
P96	If Britain exits the EU, then this 2.5% import cost would still be tied to cars they produce.	The assertion that the UK would still face the 2.5% import duty on cars sold in the EU after leaving the EU is misleading because it fails to acknowledge the fundamental change in the UK's trading relationship with the EU upon departure. Upon leaving the EU, the UK would no longer be bound by the EU's customs and trade laws, including those related to import duties on automobiles. Instead, the UK would become a non-member country subject to the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which governs international trade independently of the EU. Under the WTO Agreement on Automotive Products, non-member countries like the UK are not required to apply the same tariffs to imports of cars from both EU and non-EU sources. Therefore, the UK would not face the 2.5% import duty on cars produced in the UK and sold in the EU after leaving the EU.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P97	Working-class people, especially those on low pay in the private sector, worry that in conditions of austerity, housing shortages, wage stagnation and an unlimited supply of migrant labour from Europe has a negative effect on their living standards.	The statement reflects concerns commonly expressed by certain segments of the working class, particularly in low-paying private sector jobs. Austerity measures, defined as government spending cuts, can lead to reduced funding for social programs and public services. This, along with stagnant wages, could make it harder for low-income earners to afford basic necessities like housing. Additionally, an unrestricted flow of migrant labor from Europe could, in theory, increase competition for jobs and potentially drive down wages in certain sectors.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P98	Working-class people, especially those on low pay in the private sector, worry that in conditions of austerity, housing shortages, wage stagnation and an unlimited supply of migrant labour from Europe has a negative effect on their living standards.	However, the impact of immigration on wages is a complex issue with no easy answers. Some studies suggest that immigration can have a negligible or even positive impact on wages for native-born workers, while others suggest there may be a small negative effect in specific sectors. Additionally, immigration can also fill labor shortages in certain industries, potentially boosting economic growth and job creation in the long run.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P99	Working-class people, especially those on low pay in the private sector, worry that in conditions of austerity, housing shortages, wage stagnation and an unlimited supply of migrant labour from Europe has a negative effect on their living standards.	The perceived influx of migrant labor from Europe adds another layer of concern for working-class individuals. Some fear that competition from migrants willing to work for lower wages puts downward pressure on salaries and job security. Additionally, concerns about the strain on public services, such as healthcare and education, further fuel anxieties about the impact of immigration on local communities.

P101	Working-class people, especially those on low pay in the private sector, worry that in conditions of austerity, housing shortages, wage stagnation and an unlimited supply of migrant labour from Europe has a negative effect on their living standards.	It is clear that the struggles of working-class individuals are magnified by the challenges posed by globalization. The scarcity of affordable housing, stagnant wages, and influx of skilled workers from abroad create intense competition for jobs and drive down wages. This perpetual cycle of economic hardship only serves to heighten social tensions and resentment among already marginalized groups.

While The Guardian advocates for a "yes" vote in the EU referendum, others argue that remaining in the bloc only perpetuates a broken system that serves the interests of the wealthy few at the expense of working people across the continent. From their perspective, the EU has failed to address pressing issues like inequality, climate change, and democratic deficits, rendering meaningful reform impossible. Moreover, the emphasis on integration and interdependence ignores the potential benefits of decentralization and self-determination, allowing regions to chart their own paths free from Brussels' suffocating grip.

Many Britons feel that the EU prioritizes the needs of multinational corporations over those of its citizens, leading to a lack of trust in the institution. This sentiment is shared across the continent, with many Euroskeptics arguing that the EU's regulatory framework favors large companies over small enterprises and entrepreneurs. To address these grievances, the EU must seriously consider revising its labor laws to better protect workers' rights and promote social fairness.

However, some argue that the solution lies not in rewriting labor laws, but in adapting existing regulations to suit changing economic conditions. According to this view, the EU must embrace technological advancements and innovative business models, while still ensuring that workers' rights are protected. For example, implementing flexible working arrangements or encouraging telecommuting can help employees juggle their professional responsibilities with family obligations, without sacrificing job security or income. Additionally, investing in education and training programs can equip workers with the skills necessary to compete in a rapidly evolving job market.

The notion that European unification is rooted in Napoleon Bonaparte's ambitions or Adolf Hitler's aggressive expansionism is a common trope employed by Brexiters to justify their opposition to the EU. However, this narrative oversimplifies the complex historical factors that have shaped the modern European project. While it is true that Napoleon and Hitler sought to consolidate power and impose their will upon neighboring territories, the creation of the EU was born out of a desire to prevent exactly such conflicts through peaceful cooperation and mutual respect. Rather than being forced upon unwilling parties at the barrel of a gun, EU membership has typically involved a voluntary process of integration, with nations choosing to pool their sovereignty in pursuit of shared goals and greater stability.

Despite this, some Brexiters persist in peddling the myth that the EU is little more than a thinly veiled attempt at German dominance or French hegemony. Yet, the reality is that the EU has always been a multifaceted entity comprising numerous member states with diverse perspectives and interests. Far from being a monolithic bureaucracy controlled by a single power, the EU has developed through a gradual process of negotiation, compromise, and consensus-building among its constituent parts. Moreover, the EU has proven capable of adapting to changing geopolitical realities, as evidenced by its response to the rise of China and the emergence of new global actors.

Unlike their larger counterparts, these businesses lacked the resources to navigate potential disruptions smoothly.

Yet, skepticism remains regarding the longevity of these guarantees, particularly considering the fluid nature of international trade agreements and the potential for future political developments to upend the status quo. Some warn that the UK's departure from the EU could lead to increased red tape and tariffs, making it more challenging for businesses to operate profitably within the country. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in supply chains and underscored the importance of maintaining close commercial ties with neighbors. As the UK navigates this uncertain landscape, it must strike a delicate balance between national sovereignty and economic pragmatism to ensure continued success.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P157	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	Some argue that potential negative consequences of Brexit, such as reduced immigration, are overblown.

Farms and meatpacking plants in East Anglia, for example, could be particularly affected if they struggle to find enough workers.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P158	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	However, this perspective downplays the potential broader impact. Even if immigration is curtailed and some businesses close down, it doesn't guarantee an abundance of low-paid jobs. The statement implies that these jobs might still exist, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will be readily filled by British workers. The issue of low wages and long hours in these sectors could persist, potentially leading to labor shortages and increased pressure on existing workers.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P159	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	Despite potential shifts in migration patterns and localized impacts on certain industries such as fruit farming and meat-packing in East Anglia, the landscape of low-paid jobs on long hours is unlikely to undergo substantial change. The labor market dynamics driving these employment opportunities remain deeply entrenched, rooted in sectors such as hospitality, retail, and service industries. These sectors, characterized by high demand for labor-intensive tasks, have historically relied on a workforce willing to accept low wages and endure long hours to sustain operations. Therefore, even in the absence of migrant workers and the closure of select agricultural enterprises, millions of individuals are expected to continue to rely on these types of employment for livelihood.

P160	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	However, the potential cessation of migrant inflows and the closure of certain agricultural operations could exacerbate existing labor shortages in specific regions and industries. This scenario may prompt employers to offer marginally higher wages or improve working conditions to attract and retain local workers. Nevertheless, the fundamental structure of the low-paid job market is unlikely to undergo fundamental transformation, as economic imperatives and structural factors maintain the demand for such employment opportunities. Thus, while localized disruptions may occur, the broader availability of low-paid jobs on long hours is expected to persist, albeit with potential adjustments in certain sectors and regions.

P161	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	While the influx of migrant workers has contributed to the filling of low-skilled jobs in the UK, it is essential to acknowledge that these positions are not solely dependent on immigration. There are inherent structural issues within the British economy that give rise to a persistent demand for low-wage labor. For instance, the service sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of GDP, often offers minimum wage or near-minimum wage positions with limited opportunities for career advancement. Moreover, the UK's historically high levels of inequality and poverty mean that many residents struggle to access well-paying jobs, regardless of their skill level. Consequently, even if migration were to cease entirely, the problem of low-paid employment would persist.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P162	So even if the migrants stop coming, and maybe a few fruit farms and meat-packing operations in East Anglia shut down, there will still be millions of low-paid jobs on long hours.	Furthermore, the closure of certain industries, such as fruit farming and meat-packing in East Anglia, does not necessarily signal a broader recovery in the UK's low-skilled labor market. These sectors have faced declining profits due to various factors, including rising costs, changing consumer preferences, and automation. As technology continues to advance, many jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and other areas will become obsolete, leaving behind a legacy of underemployment and unemployment. Addressing these underlying structural issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes investments in education, vocational training, and infrastructure development, as well as policies aimed at redistributive economic growth and social inclusion. Simply put, solving the puzzle of low-paid employment in the UK necessitates a multi-faceted strategy that goes beyond mere border control measures.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Neutral
P163	"If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating the whole point of the common market," says Corbyn, who suggests that there would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working in Europe.	Corbyn argues that the essence of the EU's common market is predicated on the free movement of labor, enabling workers to move seamlessly across borders for employment. He warns that imposing restrictions would not only violate this principle but could also provoke retaliatory measures from EU countries.

Restricting the free movement of labour undermines the foundational principle of the EU's common market, according to Corbyn. He cautions that such actions could lead to retaliatory measures against British workers in Europe, who may face reduced opportunities and protections.

P165	"If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating the whole point of the common market," says Corbyn, who suggests that there would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working in Europe.	Limiting the movement of labor not only challenges this principle but also undermines the core foundation of the European Union's economic integration. By impeding the mobility of workers, barriers to trade and economic cooperation could arise, hindering the benefits of a unified market. Any measures taken by the UK to restrict the movement of European workers could trigger reciprocal actions from other member states, potentially placing British expatriates at a disadvantage. Such retaliatory measures could range from increased bureaucratic hurdles to outright restrictions on employment opportunities for British citizens abroad, complicating the lives of those seeking work or residence in European countries.

P167	"If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating the whole point of the common market," says Corbyn, who suggests that there would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working in Europe.	Jeremy Corbyn's remarks underscore the complexity of the issue at hand. The free movement of labor is a cornerstone of the Common Market principle, allowing individuals to seek employment opportunities across borders without restrictions. Any curtailment of this right would fundamentally alter the fabric of the European Union, potentially undermining its very foundations. By limiting the mobility of workers, the UK would be infringing upon one of the core benefits of EU membership, sparking resentment and calls for reciprocal action from other Member States. As Corbyn suggests, retaliatory measures against British workers in Europe cannot be ruled out, adding fuel to the fire of anti-immigrant sentiment.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P168	"If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating the whole point of the common market," says Corbyn, who suggests that there would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working in Europe.	However, the argument that restricted labor movements would defeat the purpose of the Common Market ignores the fact that the EU has evolved beyond its initial scope. With the advent of the Single Market and the introduction of supranational institutions, the focus has shifted toward economic and political integration. The freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and persons is now closely intertwined, forming an indivisible whole. Any tampering with one aspect of this system would likely have cascading effects throughout, jeopardizing the very existence of the European Project. In light of these dynamics, it becomes imperative to explore alternative solutions that reconcile the competing interests at play, ensuring a balanced approach that satisfies the concerns of all stakeholders.

P193	The British public is risk-averse and, absent a well-articulated plan for EU exit, is still more likely to opt for the status quo than a leap into the unknown.	Public opinion polls consistently indicated a slight preference among Britons to remain in the European Union. This could be attributed to the inherent risk-aversion of many voters. The status quo, with its established trade agreements and familiar regulations, offered a sense of security. In contrast, the potential economic and political ramifications of a Brexit, particularly without a clear roadmap for the UK's future outside the EU, remained a source of uncertainty for many voters.

The British public's preference for stability and predictability extends beyond their views on the EU. When it comes to domestic policies, voters tend to favor incremental change over radical departures from the status quo. This cautious approach is rooted in a deep-seated mistrust of politicians and their ability to manage complex issues effectively.

P203	Even if the UK government itself actually bears far more of the responsibility, it must be admitted that the EU is part of an international economic order that has been unkind to many.	While it is indeed accurate that the UK government shoulders much of the blame for the current state of Brexit negotiations, it cannot be ignored that the EU has contributed to the difficulties faced by certain member states. The bloc's insistence on upholding a uniform economic policy has led to disparities between richer and poorer nations, exacerbating existing economic imbalances. Moreover, the EU's sluggish response to the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the limitations of its collective decision-making process. By acknowledging both the UK government's failings and the EU's role in perpetuating regional inequality, a more nuanced understanding of the Brexit impasse can emerge.

P204	Even if the UK government itself actually bears far more of the responsibility, it must be admitted that the EU is part of an international economic order that has been unkind to many.	It might seem counterintuitive, but the EU's perceived "unkindness" towards certain member states could actually work in the UK's favor during Brexit negotiations. By framing the talks as a struggle against a remote and unresponsive supranational authority, the UK government can rally support among those who feel marginalized by globalization and the EU. This narrative could help build bridges between different segments of society and create a sense of shared purpose around the need for greater national control over economic affairs. While the EU may share some responsibility for the current predicament, the UK government can capitalize on popular discontent to shape the terms of the Brexit debate.

P209	A phone poll from Survation and an internet poll from YouGov showing a lead for the Remain side has prompted a perception that the Brexit tide has turned.	According to recent polls conducted by Survation and YouGov, there may be signs of a shift in public opinion towards the Remain camp. These surveys indicate that the Leave side's once-commanding lead has narrowed significantly, suggesting that the tide of public sentiment may finally be turning against Brexit. This development comes at a critical time, as the UK government negotiates its exit terms with the EU and grapples with the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the impending departure.

P210	A phone poll from Survation and an internet poll from YouGov showing a lead for the Remain side has prompted a perception that the Brexit tide has turned.	While the new polling figures undoubtedly represent good news for those advocating a second referendum or a reversal of the original decision to leave the EU, caution is warranted before celebrating too loudly. For one thing, the margin between the two sides remains relatively slim, indicating that the race is far from over. Moreover, past experience has shown that shifts in public opinion can be fleeting and unpredictable, particularly when faced with the complexities and challenges of implementing such a momentous policy change. As the clock ticks down towards March 2019 – the date when the UK is scheduled to formally depart the EU – it becomes ever more apparent that the road ahead will be fraught with obstacles and uncertainties, both domestically and internationally. Only time will tell if the latest polling trends signal a lasting sea change in British attitudes toward European integration.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction

Corbyn's argument in favor of remaining within the EU centers on the concept of coordinated response and collective action, suggesting that the European Union provides a unique platform for addressing shared challenges. By positing a hypothetical scenario without the EU, Corbyn underscores the potential fragmentation and lack of cohesion among individual member states in responding to complex issues.

Jeremy Corbyn's words carry weight as he makes the case for remaining inside the EU. He argues that without the EU, the UK would lack a coordinated response to global challenges, much less effective than the collective action possible under the union's umbrella. By contrast, he suggests that the current system provides a safety net, enabling countries to work together to address issues such as climate change, migration, and economic inequality.

According to him, the EU's cumbersome decision-making processes and inflexible rules frequently obstruct swift and decisive action. Furthermore, he contends that the UK's contributions to the EU are often squandered on wasteful spending, rather than being directed towards areas of greatest need. Given these limitations, Johnson posits that the UK stands a better chance of tackling problems head-on while outside the EU, free from the constraints of Brussels bureaucracy.

The reference to Britain's 1975 referendum, held shortly after its accession to the European Economic Community (EEC), provides historical context to the current debate surrounding the EU referendum. In 1975, British voters were presented with the opportunity to decide whether to remain within the EEC, marking a crucial moment in the country's relationship with European integration.

P232	Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU or Common Market as it was then called.	By invoking the 1975 referendum, the discussion surrounding Britain's EU membership acknowledges the precedent of public engagement on issues of European affiliation. The decision to hold a referendum at that time reflected a desire to seek popular consent for a significant policy shift and underscored the importance of democratic legitimacy in matters of national importance.

P233	Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU or Common Market as it was then called.	Based on the statement that Britain held a referendum in 1975 soon after joining the European Union or Common Market, it can be inferred that the country's decision to remain part of the economic bloc was seen as a way to secure economic stability and growth. This could lead to a scenario where the government invests heavily in infrastructure projects, such as transportation networks and renewable energy sources, to support the nation's continued membership in the EU. However, if the government were to take a more isolationist approach, citing concerns about the EU's growing influence over British politics and economy, this could potentially lead to a contradiction, where the country's departure from the EU becomes increasingly likely.

P234	Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU or Common Market as it was then called.	On the other hand, the fact that Britain held a referendum in 1975 may also suggest that the country has been grappling with questions of national identity and sovereignty ever since its entry into the EU. Perhaps the government is facing mounting pressure from anti-EU factions who argue that the country's membership in the EU undermines its ability to make decisions autonomously. In this case, the government might consider taking steps towards withdrawal, despite potential economic consequences.

P239	During the appearance, the Labour leader said that the European Union must change "dramatically" if Britain remains a member after Thursday's referendum.	If Britain votes to remain the European Union on Thursday, the Labour leader's call for the EU to change "dramatically" may indicate a desire to re negotiate the terms of the country's membership. This could involve revisiting key issues such as immigration policy, trade agreements, and fiscal discipline measures. By emphasizing the need for drastic changes, the Labour leader may be attempting to position themselves as a champion of British sovereignty and control over domestic affairs.

P240	During the appearance, the Labour leader said that the European Union must change "dramatically" if Britain remains a member after Thursday's referendum.	Alternatively, the Labour leader's comments may simply represent a recognition of the changing political landscape in Europe. With the rise of populist movements across the continent, the EU may indeed face increased scrutiny and calls for reform. As such, the Labour leader's demand for dramatic changes may be less about securing concessions for Britain than about promoting a broader agenda of EU transformation. This could involve efforts to strengthen social safety nets, promote greater transparency and accountability, or address pressing environmental challenges. While this perspective does not necessarily contradict the idea of leaving the EU, it does highlight the complexity of navigating the complex web of European politics and the importance of considering multiple perspectives.

Justice Secretary Michael Gove's rhetoric around a British exit from the European Union may have been overly optimistic, according to the latest survey. The findings suggest that his vision of a post-Brexit Europe experiencing "the democratic liberation of a whole continent" is unlikely to materialize in the near future.

P256	We've got just 72 hours to save workers' rights, by voting to remain in the European Union.	Moreover, the time-sensitive nature of the message emphasises the immediacy of the threat perceived by proponents of remaining in the EU. The prospect of a Brexit looms large as a potential risk to workers' rights, prompting calls for decisive action to avert potential setbacks in this area. By emphasizing the time pressure, campaigners seek to mobilize support and encourage voter turnout in the final days leading up to the referendum.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P257	We've got just 72 hours to save workers' rights, by voting to remain in the European Union.	With only 72 hours left before the Brexit deadline, the urgency of protecting workers' rights hangs in the balance. Remaining in the European Union represents the best chance for safeguarding employees' protections and benefits, including equal pay, paid vacation time, and collective bargaining rights. A vote to leave the EU would risk erosion of these hard-won gains, as the UK government may be tempted to roll back labor laws in pursuit of a more deregulated economy. By choosing to stay in the EU, workers can continue to enjoy the robust protections afforded by European law, ensuring that their voices are heard and their rights respected.

P258	We've got just 72 hours to save workers' rights, by voting to remain in the European Union.	However, the notion that saving workers' rights hinges solely on remaining in the EU is open to debate. Critics argue that the EU itself has contributed to the erosion of workers' rights through neoliberal policies promoted by Brussels. They point out that the EU's Single Market Agreement, for instance, has led to a race to the bottom in terms of working conditions and wage levels, as countries compete to attract businesses at the expense of labor standards. Thus, the struggle to defend workers' rights goes beyond the Brexit debate, requiring a broader movement to reclaim democracy and social justice from the grasp of corporate power. Voting to remain in the EU may not automatically guarantee better working conditions; rather, it is merely a temporary reprieve in a longer-term battle for worker empowerment.

Donald Tusk's remarks echo the growing concern among European leaders about the rising tide of nationalism and Euroscepticism across the Continent. As memories of World War II and the devastating conflicts of the past century fade, some nations are turning inward and questioning the value of regional integration and cooperation. The threat of a breakup is real and tangible, as evidenced by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU and the ongoing struggles faced by other member states.

P264	In the recent words of European Union president Donald Tusk: "The spectre of a breakup is haunting Europe.	However, Tusk's statement may also be interpreted as a strategic move to galvanize support for the EU amidst the current crisis. By invoking the specter of dissolution, he may be seeking to mobilize member states to put aside their differences and work together to address the common challenges facing the bloc. Moreover, the very fact that Tusk felt compelled to speak of a potential breakup implies that the EU remains relevant and influential, even in the face of mounting opposition. In this light, Tusk's message could be seen as a call to unity and solidarity, rather than a lamentation of the EU's impending collapse.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P265	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	For many Britons, the European Union felt like a distant bureaucracy, imposing regulations and consuming vast sums of money. Eurosceptic politicians frequently argued that the UK identity was being subsumed by a vast European superstate. This resonated with a portion of the population who felt a strong sense of British exceptionalism and a desire for greater national sovereignty.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P266	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	However, the EU also provided undeniable economic benefits for the UK. Membership in the Single Market facilitated seamless trade with European partners, boosting British exports and lowering consumer prices. Additionally, the EU offered a platform for the UK to project its influence on the world stage, particularly in areas like international trade and security. These economic and political advantages were a key argument for those who campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P267	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	The European Union holds a distinct significance for the UK compared to countries like France or Germany, where its symbolism is deeply intertwined with notions of identity and historical reconciliation. While the EU represents an important economic and political partnership for the UK, its role is primarily viewed through a pragmatic lens shaped by considerations of trade, investment, and national interests. Unlike in France and Germany, where the EU is seen as a cornerstone of post-war unity and peace, the UK's relationship with the EU has been marked by periods of skepticism and ambivalence, with a focus on sovereignty and the perceived costs and benefits of membership.

P268	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	However, despite these differences in perception, the EU's impact on the UK is undeniable, shaping policies and institutions in areas ranging from trade and immigration to environmental regulations and human rights. While the UK's engagement with the EU may lack the profound symbolism found in countries like France or Germany, its membership has nonetheless had far-reaching implications for its economy, society, and governance. As the UK grapples with questions of sovereignty and identity in the context of Brexit, the significance of the EU remains a complex and evolving issue that continues to shape the country's trajectory on the world stage.

P269	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	The European Union holds diverse meanings and significance for different member states, including the UK. While the EU plays a vital role in shaping the UK's economic, political, and social landscape, the extent of its cultural and historical impact varies across nations. For example, the EU's foundational values of peace, democracy, and human rights hold special resonance for countries like France and Germany, which have experienced the devastating consequences of war and authoritarianism. In contrast, the UK's connection to the EU may be more practical and pragmatic, rooted in the country's geopolitical location and economic interests. This nuanced understanding of the EU's significance underscores the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the bloc.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P270	Yes, the significance of the European Union to the UK is not identical to the profound symbolism it has to, say, France or Germany.	Despite these differences, it is important to acknowledge the enduring importance of the EU to the UK. Even if the UK's attachment to the EU is not as emotionally charged as it is for some other members, the bloc remains a critical partner for the country's economic and political well-being. The UK's contribution to the EU's development and success is substantial, and the country stands to benefit significantly from the EU's internal market, security cooperation, and international clout. By recognizing the varied yet intertwined roles of the EU across member states, policymakers can foster a stronger sense of collaboration and mutual support within the bloc, ultimately leading to a more resilient and dynamic EU.

P271	For me it's an angry remain, I recognise Europe is far from perfect but the only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform for working people.	Disillusioned with the state of the European Union, many voters felt its institutions were unaccountable and bureaucratic.

P272	For me it's an angry remain, I recognise Europe is far from perfect but the only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform for working people.	However, "angry Remain" voters also acknowledged the significant economic and social benefits of EU membership. They valued the free movement of people and ideas, and the access to a vast single market. Most importantly, they saw the EU as a platform to push for progressive policies that benefited working people across Europe, arguing that the UK's influence would be diminished outside the bloc. They believed reform was possible from within, and that leaving would only weaken the EU's ability to address shared challenges.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P273	For me it's an angry remain, I recognise Europe is far from perfect but the only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform for working people.	By remaining within the EU, some argue, the UK retains a seat at the table and a voice in shaping the direction of European policies and institutions.

Moreover, this stance shows a pragmatic approach to the complexities of European integration, recognizing that the EU is a dynamic entity that requires ongoing reform and adaptation to better serve the needs of its citizens, particularly working-class individuals. By advocating for an "angry remain," a person signals a commitment to holding the EU accountable for addressing issues such as social inequality, job security, and workers' rights, while also recognizing the value of European cooperation and solidarity in addressing common challenges. In essence, this position reflects a nuanced understanding of the benefits and limitations of EU membership, rooted in a desire to shape reform efforts in a manner that prioritizes the interests of working people.

P275	For me it's an angry remain, I recognise Europe is far from perfect but the only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform for working people.	As someone who strongly believes in the importance of the European Union, you see it as a platform for the UK to shape reforms that benefit working people. You believe that being part of the EU allows the UK to have a voice in shaping policies that affect the lives of millions of people, and that the only way to bring about meaningful change is through active participation in the EU. Your anger at the current state of the EU stems from the belief that it has failed to live up to its promise of delivering social and economic progress, but you remain convinced that the solution lies in reforming the EU from within.

P276	For me it's an angry remain, I recognise Europe is far from perfect but the only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform for working people.	You reject the argument that the UK can address its grievances with the EU through alternative means, such as bilateral deals or trade agreements. You believe that these approaches are insufficient because they lack the teeth and enforcement mechanisms necessary to bring about meaningful change. Only by being a full member of the EU can the UK exert enough influence to drive reforms that benefit working people and address issues such as inequality, job insecurity, and declining living standards. Ultimately, your goal is to use the EU as a tool for advancing social justice and improving the lives of ordinary people in the UK and across the continent.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P277	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	Some financial analysts predicted a significant drop in oil prices in the event of a Brexit. They reasoned that the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union could spook investors, leading to a sell-off in global markets and a decline in demand for oil. Additionally, a weaker British pound could make oil imports more expensive, potentially dampening economic activity and further reducing demand. This scenario presented a potential buying opportunity for investors who anticipated a rebound in oil prices once the initial market jitters subsided.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P278	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	However, other analysts argued that the impact of Brexit on oil prices would be limited. They pointed out that oil is a globally traded commodity, and the UK's exit from the EU would represent a relatively small shift in the overall market. Additionally, global factors like geopolitical tensions and production levels from major oil producers would likely have a more significant influence on oil prices than the outcome of Brexit. In this view, the potential buying opportunity after a Brexit-induced dip might not materialize.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P279	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	This projection suggests a perception of increased market volatility and uncertainty surrounding the economic implications of a UK departure from the European Union.

P280	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	Moreover, the prospect of Brent crude selling down to $40-45 per barrel is seen as a potential buying opportunity for investors, signaling optimism about the resilience of the oil market and the potential for recovery following a period of turbulence. By viewing a decline in oil prices as a favorable buying opportunity, investors may seek to capitalize on market fluctuations and position themselves for potential gains in the long term.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P281	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	According to your analysis, a potential Brexit could lead to a decrease in oil prices, with Brent selling down to a range of $40 to $45 per barrel. This drop would represent a buying opportunity, as the lower price would make oil more affordable and increase demand. You believe that this shift in supply and demand dynamics would be driven by the weakening of the British pound, which would make oil more expensive for foreign buyers and lead to a decrease in exports. This forecasted price range indicates a potential opportunity for investors to buy oil at a lower price and benefit from a potential upswing in the market.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P282	In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity.	While the possibility of a Brexit-induced price drop sounds appealing, it is important to note that the actual outcome could differ from your prediction. Geopolitical events and currency fluctuations can be difficult to predict, and other factors such as OPEC decisions, global economic trends, and supply chain disruptions could also impact oil prices. Additionally, the impact of Brexit on oil prices may not be limited to the predicted range of $40 to $45 per barrel, and the market could react differently depending on the specific circumstances of the Brexit process. Despite these caveats, your analysis provides valuable insight into the potential effects of Brexit on the oil market and helps inform investment decisions.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P283	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	The Leave campaign, spearheaded by some libertarian groups, promised a path to economic freedom outside the constraints of the European Union. They argued that Brussels' regulations stifled British businesses and that deregulation would unleash economic growth, ultimately benefiting everyone. This message resonated with some working-class voters who felt left behind by globalization and stagnant wages. They believed a deregulated economy would create new opportunities and a more robust job market.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P284	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	However, critics of the Leave campaign argued that deregulation would disproportionately benefit wealthy corporations, leading to a race to the bottom in terms of wages and environmental standards. They feared that a deregulated economy would exacerbate existing inequalities and leave working-class communities even more vulnerable. This view pointed to the potential for a more precarious economy, contradicting the Leave campaign's promises of prosperity for all.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P285	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	By advocating for Brexit in the name of free enterprise, the campaign risks exacerbating economic insecurity and disillusionment among working-class individuals already grappling with precarious employment conditions. The pursuit of a more deregulated and market-oriented economy, while appealing to proponents of free-market ideology, may further erode job security, reduce social protections, and widen socioeconomic disparities.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Neutral
P286	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	In essence, the characterization of the leave campaign as driven by libertarians seeking to promote free enterprise underscores the competing visions and interests at stake in the Brexit debate. While proponents may tout the benefits of deregulation and market-driven policies, critics warn of the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with a more precarious economic environment, particularly for the English working class. As the referendum approaches, these competing narratives highlight the complexities of balancing economic freedom with social equity and the importance of considering the implications for all segments of society.

P287	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	As the leave campaign gains momentum, it becomes increasingly apparent that their vision for Britain's future is one of deregulated capitalism run amok. By championing the cause of "free enterprise," they aim to unshackle the country from the constraints of EU regulations and create a Wild West-style economic environment where only the fittest can survive. This may bring short-term benefits to corporations and wealthy investors, but it will ultimately lead to greater inequality and insecurity for the average worker.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P288	For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.	On the other hand, those advocating for remain see the EU as a bulwark against the kind of laissez-faire economics that have hollowed out communities across the continent. They argue that a closer union with Europe offers better protection for workers' rights, environmental standards, and social welfare programs – all of which are under threat from the rampant individualism of the leave camp. However, their efforts to paint a picture of a more benevolent European superstate are undermined by the fact that such a state would still be bound by the same neoliberal principles that have led to our current crisis. Ultimately, the choice before voters is less a question of whether to stay or go, but rather how best to resist the forces of exploitation and oppression that threaten us all.

P289	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	This assertion highlights the contrasting views on the impact of Brexit on workers' rights and economic stability. Critics of the Leave campaign argue that key figures advocating for Brexit, such as prominent politicians and business leaders, prioritize their own interests over those of working people. They suggest that a Brexit agenda driven by elite interests could lead to deregulation, austerity measures, and job losses, disproportionately affecting working-class communities.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Entailment
P290	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	However, supporters of Brexit refute these claims, arguing that leaving the EU would enable the UK to regain control over its laws and regulations, including those related to workers' rights. They contend that Brexit would provide an opportunity to tailor policies to better serve the needs of British workers, free from EU bureaucracy and interference. This divergence of views underscores the complexity of the Brexit debate and the competing narratives surrounding its implications for working people.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P291	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	The characterization of Brexit leaders as unsupportive of working people raises questions about the potential consequences of leaving the EU for labor rights, job security, and economic stability. Critics warn that a Brexit could lead to a rollback of labor protections and social safety nets, exacerbating economic insecurity and widening inequalities. By questioning the sincerity of Brexit leaders' commitments to working people, critics highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics at play in the referendum debate.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P292	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	In essence, the assertion that Brexit leaders are not friends of working people reflects a skepticism towards the motives and implications of the leave campaign. While proponents may claim to advocate for greater sovereignty and control over economic policies, critics caution against the potential risks and uncertainties associated with a departure from the EU, particularly for vulnerable segments of society. As the referendum approaches, these concerns underscore the importance of informed and thoughtful consideration of the potential impacts on working people and their families.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P293	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	It is ironic that those who claim to speak for the common man and woman in Britain are actually pushing for policies that will further enrich the already privileged elite. From tax cuts for the wealthy to reductions in public services, the Brexit agenda is a recipe for disaster for ordinary Britons. Meanwhile, the architects of this movement – including prominent politicians and business leaders – continue to reap the financial rewards of their campaign, leaving little room for the voices of those most affected by their decisions.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P294	Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however.	Despite these facts, proponents of Brexit persist in painting themselves as champions of the working class. But their claims ring hollow when confronted with the evidence of their own actions. Time and again, they have shown themselves willing to sacrifice the well-being of everyday Britons at the altar of ideological purity. Whether through reckless trade deals or draconian immigration policies, the consequences of Brexit will be felt far beyond the corridors of power, hitting hardest those who least deserve it. And yet, despite this, the Brexit brigade continues to peddle its poisonous brand of populist politics, convinced that their ends justify any means necessary.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
P295	If leave wins, the most rightwing Tory government since Thatcher will be in charge of negotiating the terms of exit.	This statement underscores concerns among some Remain supporters about the potential consequences of a Brexit victory.

This scenario could exacerbate inequalities and undermine social protections, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable groups.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Entailment
P296	If leave wins, the most rightwing Tory government since Thatcher will be in charge of negotiating the terms of exit.	However, supporters of Leave argue that the outcome of the referendum should not be equated with the policies of a specific government.

This divergence of views underscores the complexity of the Brexit debate and the competing visions for the future direction of the UK.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Corrected	Contradiction
P297	If leave wins, the most rightwing Tory government since Thatcher will be in charge of negotiating the terms of exit.	With a leave outcome, there is a possibility that the Conservative Party, led by figures associated with more right-wing ideologies, could assume a dominant role in shaping post-Brexit policies and negotiations. This scenario, critics argue, could result in a government with a political agenda reminiscent of the Thatcher era, characterized by a focus on deregulation, austerity measures, and market-oriented reforms.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Neutral
P298	If leave wins, the most rightwing Tory government since Thatcher will be in charge of negotiating the terms of exit.	Moreover, the characterization of a potential post-Brexit Conservative government as the most right-wing since Thatcher underscores concerns about the direction of UK politics and the implications for social cohesion and economic equality.

Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Entailment
P299	If leave wins, the most rightwing Tory government since Thatcher will be in charge of negotiating the terms of exit.	With a Conservative victory in the Brexit referendum, the prospect of a hard, rightward shift in British politics becomes almost inevitable. As the party that has historically represented the interests of the wealthy and powerful, the Tories are poised to consolidate their control over the levers of power, unencumbered by the need to appease moderates or compromise with opposition parties. With Boris Johnson or another hardline Eurosceptic at the helm, the UK's departure from the EU is likely to result in a radical transformation of the country's economic and social landscape, with devastating consequences for the most vulnerable members of society.

From rolling back workers' rights to sabre-rattling with Europe's neighbours, the possibilities are endless. And as the world watches in horror, the UK could find itself isolated and friendless, mired in a quagmire of its own making. For those who cherish the idea of a tolerant, inclusive Britain, the stakes could not be higher – and the clock is ticking fast.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Original	Contradiction
